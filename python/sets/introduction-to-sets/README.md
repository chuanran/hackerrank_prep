### Problem

A set is an unordered collection of elements without duplicate entries. 
When printed, iterated or converted into a sequence, its elements will appear in an arbitrary order.

**Tasks**

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

**Input Format**

The first line contains the integer, N, the total number of plants.  
The second line contains the N space separated heights of the plants.

**Output Format**

Output the average height value on a single line.

**Sample Input 0**

```
10
161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
169.375
```

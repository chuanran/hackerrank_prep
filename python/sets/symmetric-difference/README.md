https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/symmetric-difference

**Tasks**

Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. 
The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.

**Input Format**

The first line of input contains an integer, M.  
The second line contains M space-separated integers.  
The third line contains an integer, N.  
The fourth line contains N space-separated integers.

**Output Format**

Output the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.

**Sample Input 0**

```
4
2 4 5 9
4
2 4 11 12
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
5
9
11
12
```

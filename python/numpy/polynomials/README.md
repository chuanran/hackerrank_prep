**Problem**

**poly**
The poly tool returns the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.

**roots**
The roots tool returns the roots of a polynomial with the given coefficients.

**polyint**
The polyint tool returns an antiderivative (indefinite integral) of a polynomial.

**polyder**
The polyder tool returns the derivative of the specified order of a polynomial.

**polyval**
The polyval tool evaluates the polynomial at specific value.

**polyfit**
The polyfit tool fits a polynomial of a specified order to a set of data using a least-squares approach.

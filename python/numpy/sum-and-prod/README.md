# Sum and Prod  

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/np-sum-and-prod

**Problem**

**sum**
The sum tool returns the sum of array elements over a given axis.  
By default, the axis value is None. Therefore, it performs a sum over all the dimensions of the input array.

**prod**
The prod tool returns the product of array elements over a given axis.
By default, the axis value is None. Therefore, it performs the product over all the dimensions of the input array.

**Task**

You are given a 2-D array with dimensions N X M. 
Your task is to perform the sum tool over axis 0 and then find the product of that result.

**Input Format**
    
The first line of input contains space separated values of N and M. 
The next N lines contains M space separated integers.

**Output Format**

Compute the sum along axis 0. Then, print the product of that sum.

**Sample Input 0**

```
2 2
1 2
3 4
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
24
```

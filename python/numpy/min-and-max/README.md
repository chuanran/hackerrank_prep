# Min and Max

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/np-min-and-max

**Problem**

**min**
The tool min returns the minimum value along a given axis.  
By default, the axis value is None. Therefore, it finds the minimum over all the dimensions of the input array.

**max**
The tool max returns the maximum value along a given axis.  
By default, the axis value is None. Therefore, it finds the maximum over all the dimensions of the input array.

**Task**

You are given a 2-D array with dimensions N X M. 
Your task is to perform the min function over axis 1 and then find the max of that.

**Input Format**
    
The first line of input contains space separated values of N and M. 
The next N lines contains M space separated integers.

**Output Format**

Compute the min along axis 1 and then print the max of that result.

**Sample Input 0**

```
4 2
2 5
3 7
1 3
4 0
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
3
```

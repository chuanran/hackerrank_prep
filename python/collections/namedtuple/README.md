# collections.namedtuple()

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-collections-namedtuple

### Problem

Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.   
They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.   
With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple. 

**Task** 

Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's IDs, marks, class and name.  
  
Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average marks of the students.  

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer N, the total number of students.   
The second line contains the names of the columns in any order.   
The next N lines contains the IDs, marks, class and name under their respective column names.

**Output Format**

Print the average marks of the list corrected to 2 decimal places.

**Sample Input 0**

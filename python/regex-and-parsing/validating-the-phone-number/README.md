# Validating phone numbers

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-the-phone-number

### Problem

Let's dive into the interesting topic of regular expressions! You are given some input, and you are required to check whether they are valid mobile numbers.  
  
A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with a 7, 8 or 9.

**Input format**

The first line contains an integer N, the number of inputs.
N lines follow, each containing some string.

**Output format**

For every string listed, print "YES" if it is a valid mobile number and "NO" if it is not on separate lines. Do not print the quotes.

**Sample Input 0**

```
2
9587456281
1252478965
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
YES
NO
```

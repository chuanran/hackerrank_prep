### Problem

Let's learn some new Python concepts! You have to generate a list of the first N fibonacci numbers, 0 being the first number. 
Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list. 

**Input Format**

One line of input: an integer N.

**Output Format**

A list on a single line containing the cubes of the first N fibonacci numbers.

**Sample Input 0**

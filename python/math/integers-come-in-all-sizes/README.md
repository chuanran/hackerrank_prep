# Integers Come In All Sizes

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-integers-come-in-all-sizes

**Problem**

Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 (c++ int) or 2<sup>63</sup> - 1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of a<sup>b</sup> grows really fast with increasing b.

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

**Task**

Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of a<sup>b</sup> + c<sup>d</sup>.

**Input Format**

Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.

**Output Format**

Print the result of a<sup>b</sup> + c<sup>d</sup> on one line.

**Sample Input 0**

```

```

**Sample Output 0**

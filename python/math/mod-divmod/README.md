# Mod Divmod

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-mod-divmod

**Problem**

One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a.

**Task**

Read in two integers, a and b, and print three lines. 
The first line is the integer division a//b (While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__). 
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: a%b. 
The third line prints the divmod of a and b.

**Input Format**

The first line contains the first integer, a, and the second line contains the second integer, b.

**Output Format**

Print the result as described above.

**Sample Input 0**

```
177
10
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
17
7
(17, 7)
```

# Triangle Quest 2

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/triangle-quest-2

**Problem**

You are given a positive integer N.  
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N.  

For example, a palindromic triangle of size  is:  

```
1

You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

**Input Format**  

A single line of input containing the integer N.

**Output Format**  

Print the palindromic triangle of size N as explained above.
